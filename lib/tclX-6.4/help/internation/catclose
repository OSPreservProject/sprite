          catclose [-fail|-nofail] cathandle
               Close the message catalog specified by cathandle.
               Normally, errors are ignored.  If -fail is specified,
               any errors closing the message catalog file are
               returned.  The option -nofail specifies the default
               behavior of not returning an error.  The use of -fail
               only makes sense if it was also specified in the call
               to catopen.
