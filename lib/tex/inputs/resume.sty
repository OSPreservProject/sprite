% Use the \employer and \location commands to print the names and
% cities of your employers.  \employer always starts a new paragraph,
% and should be followed by \location.
%
% \employer* is like \employer but is used for additional information
% about the employer.  It does NOT start a new paragraph, must
% NOT be followed by \location, and always forces a new line after itself.

\def\@semployer#1{{\sc #1}\\}

% The location is always flush right.  It is moved to the next
% line if there is not room left on this one.  
% See the TeXbook Chapter 14.

% This prints the date flush left.
% The major shortcoming of this file:
% There needs to be an option to print the date in the left margin,
% because many people like to do it that way.
