.SH NAME
shmget \- get shared memory segment
.SH SYNTAX

.SH DESCRIPTION
.NXR "shmget system call"
.NXA "shmget system call" "ftok subroutine"
.NXA "shmget system call" "shmctl system call"
.NXA "shmget system call" "shmop system call"
.NXR "shared memory" "getting"
The
.PN shmget
system call
returns the shared memory identifier associated with
.I key.
.sp
A shared memory identifier and associated data
structure and shared memory
segment of size
.I size
bytes 
are created for
.I key
if one of the following are true:
.RS 8
.PP
The
.I key
is equal to IPC_PRIVATE.
For further information, see intro(2).
.PP
The
.I key
does not already have a shared memory
identifier associated with it, and 
.RI ( shmflg
& IPC_CREAT ) is "true".
.RE
.PP
Upon creation, the data structure associated with the new shared memory
identifier is initialized as follows:
.RS 8
.PP
The
.BR shm_perm.cuid, shm_perm.uid, shm_perm.cgid,
and
.B shm_perm.gid
are set equal to the effective user ID
and effective group ID, respectively, of
the calling process.
.PP
The low-order 9 bits of 
.B shm_perm.mode
are set equal to the low-order 9 bits of
.I shmflg.
The
.B shm_segsz 
is set equal to the value of
.I size.
.PP
The
.BR shm_lpid, shm_nattch, shm_atime,
and
.B shm_dtime
are set equal to 0.
The
.B shm_ctime
is set equal to the current time.
.RE
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion,
a non-negative integer, namely a shared memory
identifier is returned.  Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicated the error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.NXR "shmget system call" "diagnostics"
The
.PN shmget
system call
will fail if one or more of the following are true:
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
The
.I size
is less than the system imposed minimum
or greater than the system imposed maximum. 
.TP 15
[EACCES]
A shared memory identifier exists for 
.I key
but operations permission
as specified by the low-order 9 bits of 
.I shmflg
would not be granted. 
For further information, see 
.MS errno 2 .
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
A shared memory identifier exists for
.I key
but the size of the segment associated with it is less than
.I size
and
.I size
is not equal to zero. 
.TP 15
[ENOENT]
A shared memory identifier does not exist for
.I key 
and
.RI ( shmflg
& IPC_CREAT )
is "false". 
.TP 15
[ENOSPC]
A shared memory identifier is to be
created but the system imposed limit on the
maximum number of allowed shared memory
identifiers system wide would be exceeded. 
.TP 15
[ENOMEM]
A shared memory identifier and
associate shared memory segment are to be
created by the amount of available
physical memory is not sufficient to fill
the request. 
.TP 15
[EEXIST]
A shared memory identifier exists for 
.I key
but 
.RI (( shmflg
& IPC_CREAT )
& 
.RI ( shmflg
& IPC_EXCL ))
is "true".

.SH BUGS
The System V shared memory functions are implemented at user level on top
of the mmap(2) interface.  Not all the System V functionality is
implemented.
