          chmod mode filelist
               Set permissions of each of the files in the list
               filelist to mode, where mode is an absolute numeric
               mode or symbolic permissions as in the UNIX chmod(1)
               command.  To specify a mode as octal, it should be
               prefixed with a "0" (e.g. 0622).
