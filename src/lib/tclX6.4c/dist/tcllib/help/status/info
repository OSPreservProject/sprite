          info option ?arg arg ...?
               Provide information about various internals to the  Tcl
               interpreter.    The   legal   option's  (which  may  be
               abbreviated) are:

               info args procname
                    Returns  a  list  containing  the  names  of   the
                    arguments   to   procedure   procname,  in  order.
                    Procname  must  be  the  name  of  a  Tcl  command
                    procedure.

               info body procname
                    Returns the body of procedure procname.   Procname
                    must be the name of a Tcl command procedure.

               info cmdcount
                    Returns a count of the total  number  of  commands
                    that have been invoked in this interpreter.

               info commands ?pattern?
                    If pattern isn't  specified,  returns  a  list  of
                    names  of all the Tcl commands, including both the
                    built-in commands written in  C  and  the  command
                    procedures  defined  using  the  proc command.  If
                    pattern is specified, only  those  names  matching
                    pattern  are  returned.   Matching  is  determined
                    using the same rules as for string match.

               info default procname arg varname
                    Procname  must  be  the  name  of  a  Tcl  command
                    procedure  and arg must be the name of an argument
                    to that procedure.  If arg doesn't have a  default
                    value  then  the  command returns 0.  Otherwise it
                    returns 1 and places the default value of arg into
                    variable varname.

               info exists varName
                    Returns 1 if the variable named varName exists  in
                    the  current  context (either as a global or local
                    variable), returns 0 otherwise.

               info globals ?pattern?
                    If pattern isn't specified, returns a list of  all
                    the  names  of currently-defined global variables.
                    If pattern is specified, only those names matching
                    pattern  are  returned.   Matching  is  determined
                    using the same rules as for string match.

               info level ?number?
                    If number is not specified, this command returns a
                    number  giving  the  stack  level  of the invoking
                    procedure, or 0 if the command is invoked at  top-
                    level.  If number is specified, then the result is
                    a list consisting of the name  and  arguments  for
                    the  procedure  call at level number on the stack.
                    If number is positive then it selects a particular
                    stack  level  (1  refers  to  the  top-most active
                    procedure, 2 to the procedure it  called,  and  so
                    on);  otherwise  it  gives a level relative to the
                    current level (0 refers to the current  procedure,
                    -1  to  its  caller,  and so on).  See the uplevel
                    command for more information on what stack  levels
                    mean.

               info library
                    Returns the name of the library directory in which
                    standard  Tcl  scripts are stored.  If there is no
                    such   directory   defined   for    the    current
                    installation  then an error is generated.  See the
                    library manual entry for details of the facilities
                    provided by the Tcl script library.  Normally each
                    application will have its own application-specific
                    library  in  addition  to  the Tcl script library;
                    the location of the  application-specific  library
                    should be kept in the $appLibrary global variable.

               info locals ?pattern?
                    If pattern isn't specified, returns a list of  all
                    the  names  of  currently-defined local variables,
                    including arguments to the current  procedure,  if
                    any.   Variables defined with the global and upvar
                    commands will not  be  returned.   If  pattern  is
                    specified,  only  those names matching pattern are
                    returned.  Matching is determined using  the  same
                    rules as for string match.

               info procs ?pattern?
                    If pattern isn't specified, returns a list of  all
                    the  names  of Tcl command procedures.  If pattern
                    is specified, only those  names  matching  pattern
                    are  returned.   Matching  is determined using the
                    same rules as for string match.

               info script
                    If a Tcl script file is currently being  evaluated
                    (i.e.  there  is  a call to Tcl_EvalFile active or
                    there  is  an  active  invocation  of  the  source
                    command),  then  this  command returns the name of
                    the innermost file being processed.  Otherwise the
                    command returns an empty string.

               info tclversion
                    Returns the version number for this version of Tcl
                    in  the  form  x.y,  where  changes to x represent
                    major changes with probable incompatibilities  and
                    changes  to y represent small enhancements and bug
                    fixes that retain backward compatibility.

               info vars ?pattern?
                    If pattern isn't specified, returns a list of  all
                    the    names   of   currently-visible   variables,
                    including  both   locals   and   currently-visible
                    globals.   If  pattern  is  specified,  only those
                    names matching pattern are returned.  Matching  is
                    determined  using  the  same  rules  as for string
                    match.
