          history ?option? ?arg arg ...?
               Note:  this command may not be available  in  all  Tcl-
               based applications.  Typically, only those that receive
               command  input  in  a  typescript  form  will   support
               history.   The  history command performs one of several
               operations  related   to   recently-executed   commands
               recorded  in  a  history  list.  Each of these recorded
               commands  is  referred  to  as  an   ``event''.    When
               specifying   an  event  to  the  history  command,  the
               following forms may be used:

               [1]  A number:  if positive, it  refers  to  the  event
                    with that number (all events are numbered starting
                    at 1).  If the number is negative, it  selects  an
                    event  relative to the current event (-1 refers to
                    the previous event, -2 to the one before that, and
                    so on).

               [2]  A string:  selects  the  most  recent  event  that
                    matches  the  string.   An  event is considered to
                    match the string either if the string is the  same
                    as  the  first  characters of the event, or if the
                    string matches the  event  in  the  sense  of  the
                    string match command.

               The history command  can  take  any  of  the  following
               forms:

               history
                    Same as history info, described below.

               history add command ?exec?
                    Add the command argument to the history list as  a
                    new  event.  If exec is specified (or abbreviated)
                    then the command is also executed and  its  result
                    is  returned.   If  exec  isn't  specified then an
                    empty string is returned as result.

               history change newValue ?event?
                    Replace the  value  recorded  for  an  event  with
                    newValue.   Event  specifies the event to replace,
                    and defaults to the current event (not event  -1).
                    This  command is intended for use in commands that
                    implement new forms of  history  substitution  and
                    wish  to  replace the current event (which invokes
                    the substitution) with the command created through
                    substitution.    The  return  value  is  an  empty
                    string.

               history event ?event?
                    Returns the value of the  event  given  by  event.
                    Event defaults to -1.  This command causes history
                    revision to occur: see below for details.

               history info ?count?
                    Returns a formatted string (intended for humans to
                    read)  giving  the  event  number and contents for
                    each of the events in the history list except  the
                    current  event.   If  count is specified then only
                    the most recent count events are returned.

               history keep count
                    This command may be used to change the size of the
                    history  list  to  count  events.   Initially,  20
                    events are retained in  the  history  list.   This
                    command returns an empty string.

               history nextid
                    Returns  the  number  of  the  next  event  to  be
                    recorded  in  the  history list.  It is useful for
                    things like printing the event number in  command-
                    line prompts.

               history redo ?event?
                    Re-execute the  command  indicated  by  event  and
                    return  its  result.   Event defaults to -1.  This
                    command results in history  revision:   see  below
                    for details.

               history substitute old new ?event?
                    Retrieve  the  command  given  by  event  (-1   by
                    default), replace any occurrences of old by new in
                    the command (only  simple  character  equality  is
                    supported;  no  wild cards), execute the resulting
                    command, and return the result of that  execution.
                    This  command  results  in  history revision:  see
                    below for details.

               history words selector ?event?
                    Retrieve from the command given by  event  (-1  by
                    default)  the  words given by selector, and return
                    those words in a string separated by spaces.   The
                    selector  argument  has  three  forms.  If it is a
                    single number then it selects the  word  given  by
                    that  number  (0  for  the command name, 1 for its
                    first argument, and so on).  If it consists of two
                    numbers  separated  by a dash, then it selects all
                    the  arguments  between  those   two.    Otherwise
                    selector  is  treated  as  a  pattern;  all  words
                    matching that pattern  (in  the  sense  of  string
                    match)  are  returned.  In the numeric forms $ may
                    be used to select the last word of a command.  For
                    example,  suppose  the  most recent command in the
                    history list is

                      format  {%s is %d years old} Alice [expr $ageInMonths/12]

                    Below are some history commands  and  the  results
                    they would produce:


                         history words $ 
                                 [expr $ageInMonths/12]
                         history words 1-2
                                 {%s is %d years  old} Alice
                         history words *a*o*
                                 {%s is %d years old} [expr $ageInMonths/12]
                    History words results in  history  revision:   see
                    below for details.

               The history options event, redo, substitute, and  words
               result  in  ``history  revision''.   When  one of these
               options is invoked then the current event  is  modified
               to  eliminate  the  history command and replace it with
               the  result  of  the  history  command.   For  example,
               suppose  that  the  most  recent command in the history
               list is

                    set a [expr $b+2]

               and suppose that the next command invoked is one of the
               ones  on the left side of the table below.  The command
               actually recorded in the  history  event  will  be  the
               corresponding one on the right side of the table.


                    history                set a [expr $b+2]
                    history s a b          set b [expr $b+2]
                    set c [history w 2]    set c [expr $b+2]

               History revision is  needed  because  event  specifiers
               like -1 are only valid at a particular time:  once more
               events have been added to the history list a  different
               event  specifier  would  be  needed.   History revision
               occurs even when history is invoked indirectly from the
               current event (e.g. a user types a command that invokes
               a Tcl procedure that invokes history):   the  top-level
               command   whose  execution  eventually  resulted  in  a
               history command is replaced.  If  you  wish  to  invoke
               commands  like  history words without history revision,
               you can use history event to save the  current  history
               event and then use history change to restore it later.
