                      Extended Tcl Expermental Directory

This directory contains code that is useful in its current state, but has
not reached the level of maturity, documentation and testing that we require
to include the code in the Extended Tcl package.  We are still interested
in your input on this code, include any problems you encounter.  Included
in currently:

  o getkey.c - A command to read keys from a terminal.  Only tested under
    Sys-V.
  o debugger - A Tcl debugger.

  o tclScoket.c - Lance Ellinghouse's socket interface.
