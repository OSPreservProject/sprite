.SH COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
.PP
The argument
.BI \-P xxx
loads parameters and character definitions for typesetter
.IR xxx ,
which at the moment is typically one of
.IR ip " (imagen),"
.IR va " (varian),"
.IR vp " (versatec)"
or
.IR ter " (terminal or printer)."
.PP
.BI -F yyy
causes font information to be loaded from directory
.I yyy
instead of the default
.BI /usr/lib/font/dev xxx.
.SH GRAPHICS COMMANDS
.PP
The most significant new facility is the ability to draw
simple graphical objects  
\(em diagonal lines, circles, ellipses, arcs, splines, and filled polygons \(em
in TROFF .
.PP
The new graphical commands are
.P1
.ta 1i
\eD'l\f2 dh dv\fP'
	draw line from current position by \f2dh, dv\fP
\eD'c\f2 d\fP'
	draw circle of diameter \f2d\fP with left side at current position
\eD'e\f2 d1 d2\fP'
	draw ellipse of diameters \f2d1 d2\fP
\eD'a\f2 dh1 dv1 dh2 dv2\fP'
	draw arc counter-clockwise from current position to \f2dh1+dh2
	dv1+dv2\fP, with center at \f2dh1 dv1\fP from current position
\eD'~\f2 dh1 dv1 dh2 dv2 ...\fP'
	draw B-spline from current position by \f2dh1 dv1\fP
	then by \f2dh2, dv2\fP, then by \f2dh3, dv3\fP, then ...
\eD'g\f2 dh1 dv1 dh2 dv2 ...\fP'
	same as \eD'~\f2 dh1 ...\fP' except the gremlin spline
	algorithm is used.
\eD'p\f2 n dh1 dv1 dh2 dv2 ...\fP'
	draw polygon using stipple \f2n\fP from current stipple font
	starting at current position by \f2dh1 dv1\fP then by \f2dh2, dv2\fP,
	then by \f2dh3, dv3\fP, then ...
\eD'P\f2 n dh1 dv1 dh2 dv2 ...\fP'
	same as \eD'p\f2 n dh1 ...\fP' except no border is printed.
\eD't\f2 d\fP'
	set line thickness to \f2d\fP (set to 3 units at startup).
	The default units are ems, so \f2d\fP must be given in \f2u\fP
	units if a number of pixels is needed.
\eD's\f2 d\fP'
	set line style to \f2d\fP (set to -1 at startup).  The value is
	taken as a coordinate mask on the individual bits of the line.
	The default units are ems, so \f2d\fP must be given in \f2u\fP units.
.P2
The position after a graphical object has been drawn is
at its ``end'', where for circles and ellipses, the end
is at the right side.
As with other commands,
default units are ems horizontally and line spaces vertically.
.PP
Realistically, these commands are not intended for direct use,
but for preprocessors like PIC, IDEAL, and GRN.
.SH Other new commands
.PP
.BI .sy " commandline"
executes the command, then returns.
Output is not captured anyplace.
.PP
.BI .cf " file"
copies
.I file
into the TROFF output file at this point, uninterpreted.
Havoc ensues unless the motions in the file
restore current horizontal and vertical position.
This command hasn't been used much,
and is probably a bad idea anyway.
.PP
.BI .pi " program"
(pipe the output into
.IR program )
now works in TROFF as well as NROFF,
since it makes somewhat more sense to allow it.
.PP
.BI .st " stipple_font"
loads
.I stipple_font
as the current font used to fill polygons, with each
polygon command selecting one pattern number from the font.
The available stipple fonts are listed in the "font" manual page.
.PP
The number register
.B $$
contains the process id of the TROFF process.
.PP
The string
.B .T
contains the name of the current typesetter
(e.g.,
.IR va ,
.IR vp ,
.IR ip ).
.PP
The
.B .ft
command causes the named font to be loaded on font position 0
(which is in all other ways inaccessible) if the font exists
and is not currently mounted by default or by a
.B .fp
command.
The font must be still or again in position 0 when the line is printed.
.PP
Transparent mode (\e!) has been fixed so that transparent
output actually appears in the output;
thus special commands can be passed through to postprocessors
by witchcraft like
.P1
\&.if "\e*(.T"va" \e!x ...
.P2
(If this makes no sense to you,
you shouldn't be using it anyway.)
.SH Deletions
.PP
The
.B .fz
and
.B .li
commands are no more.
The
.BR -p ,
.B -g
and
.B +n
command line arguments have also been eliminated,
as has the
.B hp
number register.
