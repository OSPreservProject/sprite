		README for GNU development tools
	John Gilmore			23 August 91

This directory contains various GNU compilers, assemblers, linkers, 
debuggers, etc., plus their support routines, definitions, and documentation.

If you are receiving this as part of a GDB release, see the file
gdb/README for full information.


It is now possible to configure and build a variety of tools with one
command.  To build any or all of the tools contained herein, run the
``configure'' script here, e.g.:

	./configure myhosttype

followed by running ``make''.  To see all the possible tools that can
be configured here, do:

	./configure -v myhosttype

(Note that the currently distributed versions of most tools do not yet
 fit into this structure -- just GDB for now.  Others are on the way.)

See README.configure, and/or the README files in various subdirectories,
for more details.
