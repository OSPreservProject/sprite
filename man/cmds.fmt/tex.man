     TeX formats the interspersed text and commands contained in
     the named files and outputs a typesetter independent file
     (called _D_V_I which is short for _De_Vice _Independent).  TeX
     capabilities and language are described in _T_h_e _T_e_X_b_o_o_k by
     Donald E. Knuth, published by Addison-Wesley.  There is also
     an older manual, _T_e_X _a_n_d _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T, which describes the older
     version of TeX, now called TeX78, but this description is
     now obsolete.  The present version of TeX (often refered to
     internally as TeX82) incorporates literally hundreds of
     changes from this older version.

     Any arguments given on the command line to the TeX programs
     are passed to them as the first input line.  As described in
     _T_h_e _T_e_X_b_o_o_k, that line should begin with a file name or a
     \controlsequence.  The normal usage is to say ``tteexx _p_a_p_e_r''
     to start processing _p_a_p_e_r._t_e_x. The name ``paper'' will be
     the ``jobname'', and is used in forming output file names.
     If TeX doesn't get a file name in the first line, the job-
     name is ``texput''.  The default `.tex' extension can be
     overridden by specifying an extension explicitly.

     If there is no paper.tex in the current directory, TeX will
     look look through a search path of directories to try to
     find it.  The standard library on the default search path
     has the basic format package, plain.tex, described in the
     TeXbook, as well as several others.  Note that it is hardly
     ever necessary to \input plain, since the _t_e_x program has
     preloaded it.  This means that all of the control sequences
     discussed in the TeXbook are known to TeX.

     The output DVI file is written on _n_a_m_e._d_v_i where _n_a_m_e is the
     jobname.  A log of error messages goes into _n_a_m_e._l_o_g.

     Note that there have been incompatible changes in the DVI
     format between TeX78 and TeX82, so programs used to print
     TeX78 output will not work for TeX82.  A number of output
     drivers are available.  Ask your local TeX guru for informa-
     tion on what one you should use.

     There are some environment variables that can be used to set

     up directory paths to search when TeX opens a file for
     input.  For example, the _c_s_h command
       setenv TEXINPUTS .:/usr/me/mylib:/usr/local/lib/tex82
     or the _s_h command sequence
       TEXINPUTS=.:/usr/me/mylib:/usr/local/lib/tex82
       export TEXINPUTS
     would cause all invocations of tex and its derivatives to
     look for \input files first in the current directory, then
     in a hypothetical user's ``mylib'', and finally in the sys-
     tem library.  Normally, the user will place the command
     sequence which sets up the TEXINPUTS environment variable in
     the ._c_s_h_r_c or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e file.  The Environment section below
     lists the relevant environment variables, and their
     defaults.

     The _e response to TeX's error prompt causes the _v_i editor to
     start up at the current line of the current file.  There is
     an environment variable, TEXEDIT, that can be used to change
     the editor used.  It should contain a string with "%s" indi-
     cating where the filename goes and "%d" indicating where the
     decimal linenumber (if any) goes.  For example, a TEXEDIT
     string for (Gosling's) _e_m_a_c_s can be set by:
       setenv TEXEDIT "/usr/local/emacs -l/usr/lib/tex82/tex-
     start -estartline %d %s"
     (replacing the path name for the emacs as appropriate on
     your system).

     A convenient file in the library is null.tex, containing
     nothing.  When tex can't find a file it thinks you want to
     input, it keeps asking you for another file name;  respond-
     ing `null' gets you out of the loop if you don't want to
     input anything.

     Two other TeX programs, _i_n_i_t_e_x and _v_i_r_t_e_x, can be used to
     create fast-loading customized versions of TeX.  The _i_n_i_t_e_x
     program is used to create a _f_o_r_m_a_t (._f_m_t) file that permits
     fast loading of fonts and macro packages.  After processing
     the fonts and definitions desired, a \dump command will
     create the format file.  The format file is used by _v_i_r_t_e_x.
     It needs to be given a format file name as the first thing
     it reads.  A format file name is preceded by an &, which
     needs to be escaped with \ if given on the command line.
     So, for instance, one could create a file myfmt.fmt using
     initex, and then set up a cshell alias with
       alias mytex "virtex \&myfmt"
     to allow the use of ``mytex paper''.

TTRRIIVVIIAA
     TeX, pronounced properly, rhymes with ``blecchhh.''  Note
     that the proper spelling in typewriter-like output is
     ``TeX'' and not ``TEX'' or ``tex.''

BBUUGGSS
     Maybe there should be character other than & to specify for-
     mat files, since if you forget the \ on the command line, it
     doesn't do what you want!  Also, there is no way to read a
     TeX input file with no filename extension.
