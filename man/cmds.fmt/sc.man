     The spreadsheet calculator _s_c is based on rectangular tables
     much like a financial spreadsheet.  When invoked it presents
     you with a table organized as rows and columns of cells.  If
     invoked without a _f_i_l_e argument, the table is initially
     empty.  Otherwise _f_i_l_e is read in (see the _G_e_t command
     below).  Each cell may have associated with it a numeric
     value, a label string, and/or an expression (formula) which
     evaluates to a numeric value or label string, often based on
     other cell values.

     For a on-line tutorial, type the command:

          sc /sprite/lib/sc/tutorial.sc

     To print a quick reference card, type the command:

          scqref | [your_printer_commmand]

     --cc   Start the program with the recalculation being done in
          column order.

     --mm   Start the program with automatic recalculation dis-
          abled.  The spreadsheet will be recalculated only when
          the ``@'' command is used.

     --nn   Start the program in quick numeric entry mode (see
          below).

     --rr   Start the program with the recalculation being done in
          row order (default option).

     --xx   Cause the _G_e_t and _P_u_t commands (see below) to encrypt
          and decrypt data files.

     --RR   Start the program with automatic newline action set to
          increment the row (see below).

     --CC   Start the program with automatic newline action set to
          increment the column (see below).

     All of these options can be changed with the ^_T and _S com-
     mands (see below) while _s_c is running.  Options specified

     The screen is divided into four regions.  The top line is
     for entering commands and displaying cell values.  The
     second line is for messages from _s_c.  The third line and the
     first four columns show the column and row numbers, from
     which are derived cell addresses, e.g.  _A_0 for the cell in
     column A, row 0.  Note that column names are case-
     insensitive: you can enter _A_0 or _a_0.

     The rest of the screen forms a window looking at a portion
     of the table.  The total number of display rows and columns
     available, hence the number of table rows and columns
     displayed, is set by _c_u_r_s_e_s(3) and may be overridden by set-
     ting the LINES and COLUMNS environment variables, respec-
     tively.

     The screen has two cursors: a cell cursor, indicated by a
     highlighted cell and a ``<'' on the screen, and a character
     cursor, indicated by the terminal's hardware cursor.  The
     cell and character cursors are often the same.  They differ
     when you type a command on the top line.

     If a cell's numeric value is wider than the column width
     (see the _f command), the cell is filled with asterisks.  If
     a cell's label string is wider than the column width, it is
     truncated at the start of the next non-blank cell in the
     row, if any.

     Cursor control commands and row and column commands can be
     prefixed by a numeric argument which indicates how many
     times the command is to be executed.  You can type ^_U before
     a repeat count if quick numeric entry mode is enabled or if
     the number is to be entered while the character cursor is on
     the top line.

     Commands which use the terminal's control key, such as ^_N,
     work both when a command is being typed and when in normal
     mode.

     CChhaannggiinngg OOppttiioonnss

     ^^TT_o  Toggle options.  This command allows you to switch the
          state of one option selected by _o.  A small menu lists
          the choices for _o when you type ^_T.  The options
          selected are saved when the data and formulas are saved
          so that you will have the same setup next time you
          enter the spreadsheet.

          aa    Automatic Recalculation.  When set, each change in
               the spreadsheet causes the entire spreadsheet be

               recalculated.  Normally this is not noticeable,
               but for very large spreadsheets, it may be faster
               to clear automatic recalculation mode and update
               the spreadsheet via explicit ``@'' commands.
               Default is automatic recalculation on.

          cc    Current cell highlighting.  If enabled, the
               current cell is highlighted (using the terminal's
               standout mode, if available) in addition to being
               marked by the cell cursor.

          ee    External function execution.  When disabled,
               external functions (see @_e_x_t() below) are not
               called.  This saves a lot of time at each screen
               update.  External functions are disabled by
               default.  If disabled, and external functions are
               used anywhere, a warning is printed each time the
               screen is updated, and the result of @_e_x_t() is the
               value from the previous call, if any, or a null
               string.

          ll    Autolabeling.  If enabled, using the define com-
               mand (/d) causes a label to be automatically gen-
               erated in the cell to the left of the defined
               cell.  This is only done if the cell to the left
               is empty.  Default is enabled.

          nn    Quick numeric entry.  If enabled, a typed digit is
               assumed to be the start of a numeric value for the
               current cell, not a repeat count, unless preceded
               by ^_U.  The cursor controls (^_P, ^_N, ^_B, ^_F) in
               this mode will end a numeric entry.

          tt    Top line display.  If enabled, the name and value
               of the current cell is displayed on the top line.
               If there is an associated label string, the first
               character of the string value is ``|'' for a cen-
               tered string, ``<'' for a leftstring or ``>'' for
               a rightstring (see below), followed by "_s_t_r_i_n_g"
               for a constant string or {_e_x_p_r} for a string
               expression.  A constant string may be preceeded
               with a backslash (`\').  In this case the constant
               string will be used as a ``wheel'' to fill a
               column, e.g. "\-" for a line in a column, and
               "\Yeh " for "Yeh Yeh Ye".  If the cell has a
               numeric value, it follows as [_v_a_l_u_e], which may be
               a constant or expression.

          xx    Encryption.  See the --xx option.

          $$    Dollar prescale.  If enabled, all numeric ccoonn--
               ssttaannttss (not expressions) which you enter are



Sprite v1.0                                                     3

               multipled by 0.01 so you don't have to keep typing
               the decimal point if you enter lots of dollar fig-
               ures.

          rr    Newline action.  This option toggles between three
               cases.  The default is no action.  If this option
               is used once, after each command which is ter-
               minated by a newline character is completed, the
               current cell will be moved down one row.  If this
               option is used again, after each command which is
               terminated by a newline character is completed,
               the current cell will be moved right one column.
               Another use of this option will restore the
               default action.

          zz    Set newline action limits.  This option sets lim-
               its to the newline action option above.  When this
               option is invoked, the row and column of the
               current cell are remembered.  If a later newline
               action would take the current cell to the right of
               the remembered column, then the current cell is
               instead moved to the first column of the next row.
               If a newline action would take the current cell
               below the remembered row, then the current cell is
               instead moved to the top row of the next column.

          The quick numeric entry, newline action and set newline
          action limits options can be combined to allow very
          quick entry of large amounts of data.  If all the data
          to be entered is in a single row or column then setting
          the quick numeric entry and the appropriate newline
          action will allow the numbers to be entered without any
          explicit commands to position the current cell or enter
          a number.

          If the data entry involves several entries in each row
          for many rows, then setting the quick numeric entry
          option, setting the newline action to move right after
          each entry and setting the newline action limits on the
          last column on which data should be entered will allow
          the data to entered quickly.  If necessary, columns
          which do not need data to be entered can be hidden with
          the zz command.  Similar arrangements can be made for
          entering several rows of data in each column.

     SS    Set options.  This command allows you to set various
          options.  A small menu lists the options that cannot be
          changed through ^_T above.

          bbyyrroowwss/bbyyccoollss
               Specify the order cell evaluation when updating.
               These options also affect the order in which cells

               Set the maximum number of recalculations before
               the screen is displayed again. _I_t_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_s is set
               to 10 by default.

          ttbbllssttyyllee=_s
               Control the output of the _T command.  _s can be: 00
               (default) to give colon delimited fields, with no
               _t_b_l control lines; ttbbll to give colon delimited
               fields, with _t_b_l(1) control lines; llaatteexx to give a
               _L_a_T_e_X tabular environment; ssllaatteexx to give a _S_L_a_T_e_X
               (_S_c_a_n_d_i_n_a_v_i_a_n _L_a_T_e_X) tabular environment; tteexx to
               give a _T_e_X simple tabbed alignment with ampersands
               as delimiters; and ffrraammee to give a tblstyle output
               for FrameMaker.

          Other _S_e_t options are normally used only in _s_c data
          files since they are available through ^_T.  You can
          also use them interactively

     ^^FF   Move the cell cursor forward one column.

     hh,, jj,, kk,, ll
          If the character cursor is not on the top line, these
          are alternate, _v_i-compatible cell cursor controls
          (left, down, up, right).  Space is just like l (right).

     HH,, JJ,, KK,, LL
          If the character cursor is not on the top line, these
          move the cursor by half pages (left, down, up, right).

     ^^HH   If the character cursor is not on the top line, ^_H is
          the same as ^_B.

     SSPPAACCEE
          If the character cursor is not on the top line, the
          space bar is the same as ^_F.

     TTAABB  If the character cursor is on the top line, TAB starts
          a range (see below).  Otherwise, it is the same as ^_F.

     AArrrrooww KKeeyyss
          The terminal's arrow keys provide another alternate set
          of cell cursor controls if they exist and are supported
          in the appropriate _t_e_r_m_c_a_p entry.  Some terminals have
          arrow keys which conflict with other control key codes.
          For example, a terminal might send ^_H when the back
          arrow key is pressed.  In these cases, the conflicting
          arrow key performs the same function as the key combi-
          nation it mimics.

     ^^    Move the cell cursor up to row 0 of the current column.

     ##    Move the cell cursor down to the last valid row of the
          current column.

     00    Move the cell cursor backward to column A of the
          current row.  This command must be prefixed with ^_U if
          quick numeric entry mode is enabled.

     $$    Move the cell cursor forward to the last valid column
          of the current row.

     bb    Scan the cursor backward (left and up) to the previous
          valid cell.

     ww    Scan the cursor forward (right and down) to the next
          valid cell.

     ^^EE_d  Go to end of range.  Follow ^_E by a direction indicator
          such as ^_P or _j.  If the cell cursor starts on a non-
          blank cell, it goes in the indicated direction until
          the last non-blank adjacent cell.  If the cell cursor
          starts on a blank cell, it goes in the indicated direc-
          tion until the first non-blank cell.  This command is
          useful when specifying ranges of adjacent cells (see
          below), especially when the range is bigger than the
          visible window.

     gg    Go to a cell.  _s_c prompts for a cell's name, a regular
          expression surrounded by quotes, or a number.  If a
          cell's name such as _a_e_1_2_2 or a the name of a defined
          range is given, the cell cursor goes directly to that
          cell.  If a quoted regular expression such as " _T_a_x
          _T_a_b_l_e " or " ^_J_a_n [_0-_9]*$ " is given, _s_c searches for a
          cell containing a string matching the regular expres-
          sion.  See _r_e_g_e_x(_3) or _e_d(_1) for more details on the
          form of regular expressions.  If a number is given, _s_c
          will search for a cell containing that number.
          Searches for either strings or numbers proceed forward
          from the current cell, wrapping back to a0 at the end
          of the table, and terminate at the current cell if the
          string or number is not found.  You may also go to a
          cell with an ERROR (divide by zero, etc in this cell)

     both at once, i.e. each cell can have only one expression
     associated with it.  Entering a valid numeric expression
     alters the cell's previous numeric value, if any, and
     replaces the cell's previous string expression, if any,
     leaving only the previously computed constant label string.
     Likewise, entering a valid string expression alters the
     cell's the previous label string, if any, and replaces the
     cell's previous numeric expression, if any, leaving only the
     previously computed constant numeric value.

     ==    Enter a numeric constant or expression into the current
          cell.  _s_c prompts for the expression on the top line.
          The usual way to enter a number into a cell is to type
          ``='', then enter the number in response to the prompt
          on the top line.  The quick numeric entry option,
          enabled through the --nn option or ^_T command, shows the
          prompt when you enter the first digit of a number (you
          can skip typing ``='').

     <<    Enter a label string into the current cell to be
          flushed left against the left edge of the cell.

     ""    Enter a label string into the current cell to be cen-
          tered in the column.

     >>    Enter a label string into the current cell to be
          flushed right against the right edge of the cell.

     FF    Enter a format string into the current cell.  This for-
          mat string overrides the precision specified with the
          ``f'' command.  The format only applies to numeric
          values.  The following characters can be used to build
          a format string:

          ##    Digit placeholder.  If the number has fewer digits
               on either side of the decimal point than  there
               are `#' characters in the format, the extra `#'
               characters are ignored.  The number is rounded to
               the number of digit placeholders as there are to
               the right of the decimal point.  If there are more
               digits in the number than there are digit place-
               holders on the left side of the decimal point,
               then those digits are displayed.

          00    Digit placeholder.  Same as for `#' except that
               the number is padded with zeroes on either side of
               the decimal point.  The number of zeroes used in
               padding is determined by the number of digit
               placeholders after the `0' for digits on the left
               side of the decimal point and by the number of
               digit placeholders before the `0' for digits on
               the right side of the decimal point.

          ..    Decimal point.  Determines how many digits are
               placed on the right and left sides of the decimal
               point in the number.  Note that numbers smaller
               than 1 will begin with a decimal point if the left
               side of the decimal point contains only a `#'
               digit placeholder.  Use a `0' placeholder to get a
               leading zero in decimal formats.

          %%    Percentage.  For each `%' character in the format,
               the actual number gets multiplied by 100 (only for
               purposes of formatting -- the original number is
               left unmodified) and the `%' character is placed
               in the same position as it is in the format.

          ,,    Thousands separator.  The presence of a `,' in the
               format (multiple commas are treated as one) will
               cause the number to be formatted with a `,'
               separating each set of three digits in the integer
               part of the number with numbering beginning from
               the right end of the integer.

          \\    Quote.  This character causes the next character
               to be inserted into the formatted string directly
               with no special interpretation.

          EE-- EE++ ee-- ee++
               Scientific format.  Causes the number to formatted
               in scientific notation.  The case of the `E' or
               `e' given is preserved.  If the format uses a `+',
               then the sign is always given for the exponent
               value.  If the format uses a `-', then the sign is
               only given when the exponent value is negative.
               Note that if there is no digit placeholder follow-
               ing the `+' or `-', then that part of the format-
               ted number is left out.  In general, there should
               be one or more digit placeholders after the `+' or
               `-'.

          ;;    Format selector.  Use this character to separate
               the format into two distinct formats.  The format
               to the left of the `;' character will be used if
               the number given is zero or positive.  The format
               to the right of the `;' character is used if the
               number given is negative.

          Some example formats are integer (``0'' or ``#''),
          fixed (``0.00''), percentage (``0%'' or ``0.00%''),
          scientific (``0.00E+00''), and currency
          (``$#,0.00;($#,0.00)'').

          a form that matches its appearance on the screen.  This
          differs from the _P_u_t command in that its files are
          intended to be reloaded with _G_e_t, while _W_r_i_t_e produces
          a file for people to look at.  Hidden rows or columns
          are not shown when the data is printed.

     TT    Write a listing of the current database to a file, but
          include delimiters suitable for processing by the _t_b_l,
          _L_a_T_e_X, or _T_e_X table processors.  The delimiters are
          controlled by the _t_b_l_s_t_y_l_e option.  See _S_e_t above.  The
          delimiters are are a colon (:) for style _0 or _t_b_l and
          an ampersand (&) for style _l_a_t_e_x or _t_e_x.

     With the _P_u_t, _W_r_i_t_e, and _T_a_b_l_e commands, the optional range

     The three output commands, _P_u_t, _W_r_i_t_e, and _T_a_b_l_e, can pipe
     their (unencrypted only) output to a program.  To use this
     feature, enter ``| program'' to the prompt asking for a
     filename.  For example, to redirect the output of the _W_r_i_t_e
     command to the printer, you might enter ``| lpr -p''.

     MM    Merge the database from the named file into the current
          database.  Values and expressions defined in the named
          file are read into the current spreadsheet overwriting
          the existing entries at matching cell locations.

     RR    Run macros.  Since _s_c files are saved as ASCII files,
          it is possible to use them as primitive macro defini-
          tion files.  The _R_u_n command makes this easier.  It's
          like the _M_e_r_g_e command, but prints a saved path name as
          the start of the filename to merge in.  The string to
          use is set with the _D_e_f_i_n_e command.  To write macros,
          you must be familiar with the file format written by
          the _P_u_t command.  This facility is still primitive and
          could be much improved.

     DD    Define a path for the _R_u_n command to use.

     All file operations take a filename as the first argument to
     the prompt on the top line.  The prompt supplies a " to aid
     in typing in the filename.  The filename can also be
     obtained from a cell's label string or string expression.
     In this case, delete the leading " with the backspace key
     and enter a cell name such as _a_2_2 instead.  If the resulting
     string starts with ``|'', the rest of the string is inter-
     preted as a UNIX command, as above.

     These commands can be used on either rows or columns.  The
     second letter of the command is either a row designator (one
     of the characters _r, ^_B, ^_F, _h, _l) or a column designator
     (one of _c, ^_P, ^_N, _k, _j).  A small menu lists the choices
     for the second letter when you type the first letter of one
     of these commands.  Commands which move or copy cells also
     modify the row and column references in affected cell
     expressions.  The references may be frozen by using the

          The last deleted set of cells is put back into the
          spreadsheet at the current location.  _p_r inserts enough
          rows to hold the data.  _p_c inserts enough columns to
          hold the data.  _p_m (merge) does not insert rows or
          columns; it overwrites the cells beginning at the
          current cell cursor location.

          leaving only the values which were in the cells before
          the command was executed.

     zzrr,, zzcc
          Hide (``zap'') the current row (column).  This keeps a
          row (column) from being displayed but keeps it in the
          data base.  The status of the rows and columns is saved
          with the data base so hidden rows and columns will be
          still be hidden when you reload the spreadsheet.  Hid-
          den rows or columns are not printed by the _W command.

          (columns) to be revealed.  The default is the first

          points, and the format type.  Format types are 0 for
          fixed point, 1 for scientific notation, 2 for engineer-
          ing notation, and 3 for dates.  Values are rounded off
          to the least significant digit displayed.  The total
          column width affects displays of strings as well as
          numbers.  A preceding count can be used to affect more
          than one column.  This command has only a column ver-

     mand.  A small menu lists the choices for the second letter
     when you type ``/''.  _s_c prompts for needed parameters for
     each command.  Phrases surrounded by square brackets in the
     prompt are informational only and may be erased with the
     backspace key.

     Prompts requesting variable names may be satisfied with
     either an explicit variable name, such as _A_1_0, or with a
     variable name previously defined in a /_d command (see
     below).  Range name prompts require either an explicit range
     such as _A_1_0:_B_2_0, or a range name previously defined with a
     /_d command.  A default range shown in the second line is
     used if you omit the range from the command or press the TAB
     key (see below).  The default range can be changed by moving
     the cell cursor via the control commands (^_P, ^_N, ^_B, ^_F) or
     the arrow keys.  The cells in the default range are
     highlighted (using the terminal's standout mode, if avail-
     able).

     //xx   Clear a range.  Cells cleared with this command may be
          recalled with any of the _p_u_l_l commands.

     //vv   Values only.  This command removes the expressions from
          a range of cells, leaving just the values of the
          expressions.

     //cc   Copy a source range to a destination range.  The source
          and destination may be different sizes.  The result is
          always one or more full copies of the source.  Copying
          a row to a row yields a row.  Copying a column to a
          column yields a column.  Copying a range to anything
          yields a range.  Copying a row to a column or a column
          to a row yields a range with as many copies of the
          source as there are cells in the destination.  This
          command can be used to duplicate a cell through an
          arbitrary range by making the source a single cell
          range such as _b_2_0:_b_2_0.

     //ff   Fill a range with constant values starting with a given
          value and increasing by a given increment.  Each row is
          filled before moving on to the next row if row order
          recalculation is set.  Column order fills each column
          in the range before moving on to the next column.  The
          start and increment numbers may be positive or nega-
          tive.  To fill all cells with the same value, give an

          increment of zero.

     //dd   Use this command to assign a symbolic name to a single
          cell or a rectangular range of cells on the screen.
          The parameters are the name, surrounded by "", and
          either a single cell name such as _A_1_0 or a range such
          as _a_1:_b_2_0.  Names defined in this fashion are used by
          the program in future prompts, may be entered in
          response to prompts requesting a cell or range name,
          and are saved when the spreadsheet is saved with the
          _P_u_t command.  Names defined must be more than two alpha
          characters long to differentiate them from a column
          names, and must not have embedded special characters.
          Names may include the character ``_'' or numerals as
          long as they occur after the first three alpha charac-
          ters.

     //ll   Use this command to lock the current cell or a range of
          cells, i.e make them immune to any type of editing. A
          locked cell can't be changed in anyway until it is
          unlocked.

     //UU   This command is the opposite of the /_l command and thus
          unlocks a locked cell and makes it editable.

     //ss   This command lists (shows) the currently defined range
          names.  If there are no defined range names, then a
          message is given, otherwise it pipes output to _s_o_r_t,
          then to _l_e_s_s.  If the environment variable PAGER is
          set, its value is used in place of _l_e_s_s.

     //uu   Use this command to undefine a previously defined range
          name.

     //FF   Use this command to assign a value format string (see
          the ``F'' cell entry command) to a range of cells.

     !!    Shell escape.  _s_c prompts for a shell command to run.
          End the command line with the RETURN key.  If the
          environment variable SHELL is defined, that shell is
          run.  If not, /bin/sh is used.  Giving a null command
          line starts the shell in interactive mode.  A second
          ``!'' repeats the previous command.

     ^^LL   Redraw the screen.

     ^^RR   Redraw the screen with special highlighting of cells to
          be filled in.  This is useful for finding values you
          need to provide or update in a form with which you
          aren't familiar or of which you have forgotten the
          details.

          It's also useful for checking a form you are creating.
          All cells which contain constant numeric values (not
          the result of a numeric expression) are highlighted
          temporarily, until the next screen change, however
          minor.  To avoid ambiguity, the current range (if any)
          and current cell are not highlighted.

     ^^XX   This command is similar to ^_R, but highlights cells
          which have expressions.  It also displays the expres-
          sions in the highlighted cells as left-flushed strings,
          instead of the numeric values and/or label strings of
          those cells.  This command makes it easier to check
          expressions, at least when they fit in their cells or
          the following cell(s) are blank so the expressions can
          slop over (like label strings).  In the latter case,
          the slop over is not cleared on the next screen update,
          so you may want to type ^_L after the ^_X in order to
          clean up the screen.

     @@    Recalculates the spreadsheet.

     ^^VV   Type, in the command line, the name of the current cell
          (the one at the cell cursor).  This is useful when
          entering expressions which refer to other cells in the
          table.

     ^^WW   Type, in the command line, the expression attached to
          the current cell.  If there is none, the result is
          ``?''.

     ^^AA   Type, in the command line, the numeric value of the
          current cell, if any.

     The ^_V, ^_W, and ^_A commands only work when the character
     cursor is on the command line and beyond the first

     character.

     TTAABB  When the character cursor is on the top line, defines a
          range of cells via the cursor control commands or the
          arrow keys.  The range is highlighted, starts at the
          cell where you typed TAB, and continues through the
          current cell cursor.  Pressing TAB again causes the
          highlighted range to be entered into the command line
          and the highlighting to be turned off.  This is most
          useful for defining ranges to functions such as @_s_u_m().
          Pressing ``)'' acts just like typing the TAB key the
          second time and adds the closing ``)''.  Note that when
          you give a range command, you don't need to press the
          first TAB to begin defining a range starting with the
          current cell.

     VVaarriiaabbllee NNaammeess
     Normally, a variable name is just the name of a cell, such
     as _K_2_0.  The value is the numeric or string value of the
     cell, according to context.

     When a cell's expression (formula) is copied to another
     location via _c_o_p_y or _r_a_n_g_e-_c_o_p_y, variable references are by
     default offset by the amount the formula moved.  This allows
     the new formula to work on new data.  If cell references are
     not to change, you can either use the _f_i_x_e_d operator (see
     below), or one of the following variations on the cell name.

     _K_2_0  References cell _K_2_0; the reference changes when the
          formula is copied.

     $$_K$$_2_0
          Always refers to cell _K_2_0; the reference stays fixed
          when the formula is copied.

     $$_K_2_0 Keeps the column fixed at column K; the row is free to
          vary.

     _K$$_2_0 Similarly, this fixes the row and allows the column to
          vary.

     These conventions also hold on defined ranges.  Range refer-
     ences vary when formulas containing them are copied.  If the
     range is defined with fixed variable references, the refer-
     ences do not change.

     ffiixxeedd
          To make a variable not change automatically when a cell
          moves, put the word _f_i_x_e_d in front of the reference,

     Numeric expressions used with the ``='' and _e commands have
     a fairly conventional syntax.  Terms may be constants, vari-
     able names, parenthesized expressions, and negated terms.
     Ranges may be operated upon with range functions such as sum
     (@_s_u_m()) and average (@_a_v_g()).  Terms may be combined using
     binary operators.

          equivalents.

     ~~e   Boolean operator NOT.

     String expressions are made up of constant strings (charac-
     ters surrounded by double quotation marks), variables (cell
     names, which refer to the cells's label strings or expres-
     sions), and string functions.  Note that string expressions
     are only allowed when entering a cell's label string, not
     its numeric part.  Also note that string expression results
     may be left or right flushed or centered, according to the
     type of the cell's string label.

     ##                 Concatenate strings.  For example, the
                       string expression

                            A0 # "zy dog"

                       displays the string ``the lazy dog'' in
                       the cell if the value of _A_0's string is
                       ``the la''.

     @@ssuubbssttrr(se,e1,e2) Extract and return from string expression
                       _s_e the substring indexed by character
                       number _e_1 through character number _e_2
                       (defaults to the size of _s_e if beyond the
                       end of it).  If _e_1 is less than 1 or
                       greater than _e_2, the result is the null
                       string.  For example,

                            @substr ("Nice jacket", 4, 7)

                       returns the string ``e jac''.

                       ment _s_e must be a valid _p_r_i_n_t_f(3) format

                       string.  _e is converted according to the
                       standard rules.  For example, the expres-
                       sion

                            @fmt ("**%6.3f**", 10.5)

                       yields the string ``**10.500**''.  _e is a
                       double, so applicable formats are e, E, f,
                       g, and G.  Try ``%g'' as a starting point.

     @@ssvvaall(se,e)       Return the string value of a cell selected
                       by name.  String expression _s_e must evalu-
                       ate to a column name (``A''-``AE'') and _e
                       must evaluate to a row number (0-199). If
                       _s_e or _e is out of bounds, or the cell has
                       no string value, the result is the null
                       string.  You can use this for simple table
                       lookups.  Be sure the table doesn't move
                       unexpectedly!

     @@uuppppeerr(e)         and @@lloowweerr(e) will case the string expres-
                       sion to upper or lower.

     @@ccaappiittaall(e)       will convert the first letter of words in
                       a string into upper case and other letters
                       to lower case (the latter if all letters
                       of the string are upper case).

     @@uuppppeerr(e)         and @@lloowweerr(e) will case the string expres-
                       sion to upper or lower.

     @@ccaappiittaall(e)       will convert the first letter of words in
                       a string into upper case.

     @@eexxtt(se,e)        Call an external function (program or
                       script).  The purpose is to allow arbi-
                       trary functions on values, e.g. table
                       lookups and interpolations.  String
                       expression _s_e is a command or command line
                       to call with _p_o_p_e_n(3).  The value of _e is
                       converted to a string and appended to the
                       command line as an argument.  The result
                       of @_e_x_t() is a string: the first line
                       printed to standard output by the command.
                       The command should emit exactly one output
                       line.  Additional output, or output to
                       standard error, messes up the screen.
                       @_e_x_t() returns a null string and prints an
                       appropriate warning if external functions
                       are disabled, _s_e is null, or the attempt
                       to run the command fails.

                       External functions can be slow to run, and
                       if enabled are called at each screen
                       update, so they are disabled by default.
                       You can enable them with ^_T when you
                       really want them called.

                       A simple example:

                            @ext ("echo", a1)

                       You can use @_s_t_o_n() to convert the @_e_x_t()
                       result back to a number.  For example:

                            @ston (@ext ("form.sc.ext", a9 + b9))

                       Note that you can built a command line
                       (including more argument values) from a
                       string expression with concatenation.  You
                       can also "hide" the second argument by
                       ending the command line (first argument)
                       with `` #'' (shell comment).

     @@ccoollttooaa(e)        Returns a string name for a column from
                       the numeric argument.  For example:

                            @coltoa(@mycol-1)
                            @nval(coltoa(@mycol-1), @myrow+1)

     Time for _s_c follows the system standard: the number of

     @_d_a_t_e() return numbers, not strings.

     @@nnooww              Return the current time encoded as the
                       number of seconds since the beginning of

                       of days in the specified month, and the
                       year should range from 1970 to 1999.

     @@ttttss(e1,e2,e3)    @_t_t_s(8,20,45) converts the time 8:40:45 to
                       the number of seconds since midnight, the

                       range from 0 to 59.

     The following functions take the time in seconds (e.g. from
     @_n_o_w) as an argument and return the specified value.  The
     functions all convert from GMT to local time.

     @@ddaattee(e)          Convert the time in seconds to a date

     Re-evaluation of spreadsheet expressions is done by row or
     by column depending on the selected calculation order.
     Evaluation is repeated up to _i_t_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_s times for each
     update if necessary, so forward references usually work as
     expected.  See _s_e_t above.  If stability is not reached after
     ten iterations, a warning is printed.  This is usually due
     to a long series of forward references, or to unstable
     cyclic references (for example, set _A_0's expression to
     ``A0+1'').

     @@nnuummiitteerr          Returns the number of iterations performed
                       so far.

     Top-to-bottom, left-to-right evaluation of expressions is
     silly.  A proper following of the dependency graph with
     (perhaps) recourse to relaxation should be implemented.

     Only one previous value is saved from any call of @_e_x_t().
     If it is used more than once in a spreadsheet and external
     functions are enabled and later disabled, the last returned
     value pops up in several places.

     On some systems, if the cell cursor is in column 0 with top-
     line enabled (so the current cell is highlighted), or if any
     cell in column 0 is highlighted, the corresponding row
     number gets displayed and then blanked during a screen
     refresh.  This looks like a bug in _c_u_r_s_e_s.

     Many commands give no indication (a message or beep) if they
