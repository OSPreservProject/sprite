     _P_s_c is used to prepare data for input to the spread sheet
     calculator _s_c(_1). It accepts normal ascii data on standard
     input.  Standard output is a _s_c file.  With no options, _p_s_c
     starts the spread sheet in cell A0.  Strings are right jus-
     tified.  All data on a line is entered on the same row; new
     input lines cause the output row number to increment by one.
     The default delimiters are tab and space.  The column for-
     mats are set to one larger than the number of columns
     required to hold the largest value in the column.

     Options:


     -f   Omit column width calculations.  This option is for
          preparing data to be merged with an existing
          spreadsheet.  If the option is not specified, the
          column widths calculated for the data read by _p_s_c will
          override those already set in the existing spreadsheet.


     -L   Left justify strings.


     -k   Keep all delimiters.  This option causes the output
          cell to change on each new delimiter encountered in the
          input stream.   The default action is to condense mul-
          tiple delimters to one, so that the cell only changes
          once per input data item.


     -r   Output the data by row first then column.  For input
          consisting of a single column, this option will result
          in output of one row with multiple columns instead of a
          single column spread sheet.


     -s cell
          Start the top left corner of the spread sheet in _c_e_l_l.
          For example, -_s _B_3_3 will arrange the output data so
          that the spread sheet starts in column B, row 33.

     -R n Increment by _n on each new output row.


     -C n Increment by _n on each new output column.


     -n n Output _n rows before advancing to the next column.
          This option is used when the input is arranged in a
          single column and the spread sheet is to have multiple
          columns, each of which is to be length _n.


     -d c Use the single character _c as the delimiter between
          input fields.


     -P   Plain numbers only.  A field is a number only when
          there is no imbeded [-+eE].


     -S   All numbers are strings.


     -v   Print the version of psc
