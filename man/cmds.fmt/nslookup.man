     nslookup - query name servers interactively

     _N_s_l_o_o_k_u_p is a program to query DARPA Internet domain name
     servers. Nslookup has two modes: interactive and non-
     interactive.  Interactive mode allows the user to query the
     name server for information about various  hosts and domains
     or print a list of hosts in the domain. Non-interactive mode
     is used to print just the name and Internet address of a
     host or domain.


AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS
     Interactive mode is entered in the following cases:

     a)  when no arguments are given (the default name server
         will be used),

     b)  when the first argument is a hyphen (-) and the second
         argument is the hostname or Internet address of a name
         server.

     Non-interactive mode is used when the name of the host to be
     looked up is given as the first argument. The optional
     second argument specifies the hostname or Internet address
     of a name server.

     The options listed under the ``set'' command below can be
     specified on the command line if they precede the arguments
     and are prefixed with a hyphen. For example, to change the
     default query type to host information, and the default
     timeout to 10 seconds, type:

          nslookup -query=hinfo -timeout=10

     Commands may be interrupted at any time by typing a
     control-C.  To exit, type a control-D (EOF) or type exit.
     The command line length must be less than 80 characters.
     NN..BB.. an unrecognized command will be interpreted as a host
     name.


     _h_o_s_t [_s_e_r_v_e_r]
          Look up information for _h_o_s_t using the current default
          server or using _s_e_r_v_e_r if specified.

     sseerrvveerr _d_o_m_a_i_n
     llsseerrvveerr _d_o_m_a_i_n
          Change the default server to _d_o_m_a_i_n. LLsseerrvveerr uses the
          initial server to look up information about _d_o_m_a_i_n
          while sseerrvveerr uses the current default server. If an
          authoritative answer can't be found, the names of
          servers that might have the answer are returned.


     rroooott Changes the default server to the server for the root
          of the domain name space.  Currently, the host sri-
          nic.arpa is used.  (This command is a synonym for the
          llsseerrvveerr ssrrii--nniicc..aarrppaa.) The name of the root server can
          be changed with the sseett rroooott command.

     ffiinnggeerr [_n_a_m_e] [>>>> _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
          Connects with the finger server on the current host.
          The current host is defined when a previous lookup for
          a host was successful and returned address information
          (see the sseett qquueerryyttyyppee==AA command).  _N_a_m_e is optional. >>
          and >>>> can be used to redirect output in the usual
          manner.

          List the information available for _d_o_m_a_i_n, optionally
          creating or appending to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  The default output
          contains host names and their Internet addresses. The
          --aa option lists aliases of hosts in the domain.  The --hh
          option lists CPU and operating system information for
          the domain.  The --dd option lists all contents of a zone
          transfer.  When output is directed to a file, hash
          marks are printed for every 50 records received from
          the server.


     vviieeww _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
          Sorts and lists the output of previous llss command(s)
          with _m_o_r_e(1).
